# Walmart_Case_Study

## Business Problem

They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers.

## Setup and Installation
For this project one need to install necessary Python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn & scipy.stats.

## Report & Recommendations
### a. Average Amount Spent by Males and Females

### Analysis:

● The confidence intervals for males and females do not overlap, and a Z-test confirms this significant difference.

### Recommendations:

● Marketing Strategies: Develop marketing strategies and promotions specifically targeted at each gender.
● Advertising Campaigns: Create gender-specific advertising campaigns and consider offering gender-specific discounts.
Product and Inventory Management: Optimize product offerings and inventory to better cater to the preferences of male and female customers.

### Analysis:
● The average spending between married and unmarried individuals shows no significant difference.
● The confidence intervals for these groups overlap, and a Z-test confirms this finding.
### Recommendations:
● Inclusive Marketing: Design marketing campaigns and promotions that appeal equally to both married and unmarried individuals.
● Broad Audience Strategies: Focus on creating inclusive strategies that resonate with a wide audience, as there is no significant difference in spending behavior between these groups.
### c. Average Amount Spent by Different Age Groups
### Analysis:
● There are significant differences in the average amount spent by different age groups.
● The confidence intervals do not overlap, and an ANOVA test (F-test) confirms these differences.
### Recommendations:
● Targeted Product Offerings: Tailor product offerings and store layouts to match the preferences and spending habits of each age group.
● Age-Specific Promotions: Introduce age-specific promotions, loyalty programs, or product bundles to attract customers from various age demographics.
Optimized Revenue Strategies: Use insights from age-based spending patterns to optimize revenue generation strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
