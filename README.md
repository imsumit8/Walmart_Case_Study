# Walmart_Case_Study

## Business Problem

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men or not.

### Report & Recommendations
### a. Average Amount Spent by Males and Females

### Analysis:

The confidence intervals for the average amount spent by males and females, computed using all the available data, do not overlap. This indicates a significant difference in the average amount spent by males compared to females.
A Z-test confirmed that the difference in average spending between males and females is statistically significant.

### Recommendations:

Walmart can leverage this information to tailor their marketing strategies and promotions to better target each gender.
Create gender-specific advertising campaigns or offer gender-specific discounts and promotions.
Optimize product offerings and inventory management to cater to the preferences of their diverse customer base.

### b. Average Amount Spent by Married and Unmarried Individuals
### Analysis:

The confidence intervals for the average amount spent by married and unmarried individuals overlap significantly, indicating no statistically significant difference in their average spending.
A Z-test confirmed that the difference in average spending between these groups is not statistically significant.
### Recommendations:

Walmart can design marketing campaigns and promotions that appeal equally to both married and unmarried individuals.
Focus on creating inclusive marketing strategies that resonate with a broader audience, given the lack of significant difference in spending behavior between these groups.

### c. Average Amount Spent by Different Age Groups

### Analysis:

The confidence intervals for the average amount spent by different age groups do not overlap, indicating statistically significant differences in average spending between age groups.
An ANOVA test (F-test) confirmed these significant differences in spending patterns across different age groups.


### Recommendations:

Walmart can tailor their product offerings, marketing messages, and store layouts to better target the preferences and spending habits of each age group.
Introduce age-specific promotions, loyalty programs, or product bundles to attract customers from different age demographics.
Use insights from spending patterns of different age groups to optimize revenue generation strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
